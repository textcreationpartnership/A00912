1. THE SECOND PART OF A TREATISE CONCERNING POLICY AND RELIGION.

    _ THE NECESSITIE OF RELIGION, FOR THE CONseruation and perfection of the vvorlde, is proued by the reduction, and returne of all creatures to their beginning and first cause, that is to say, God their Creator. CHAP. I.

    _ In vvhat maner all creatures are reduced to God their Creator by religion, and by the vvay, the beginning, effect, vtilitie, and end of religion, is euidently declared out of the best philosophers: & consequently it is proued, that religion is so natural to man, that it can not be extuinguished, except mankind be exterminated, and the vvhole vvorlde dissolued: vvhereby the necessitie of religion, the prouidence of God, and the blindnes, and impietie of the polityke, is euidently shevved. CHAP. II.

    _ It is obiected, that the philosohers vvhich haue beene alleadged in the former chapters, vvere Idolaters, and that therfore their testimonies, for matters of Christian religion are impertinent, and not to be vsed by Christians. The obiection is ansvvered; and it is proued, that the religion vvhereof the philosophers treate, vvas true religion, consisting in the vvorship of one God, vvhom they acknovvleged to be the author of nature. Also, that philosophie is the handmaide of our deuinitie, and to be vsed for the confirmation thereof, vvith certaine considerations prouing the necessitie of religion, and the ignorance, and blindnesse of politiques. CHAP. III.

    _ To shevv the necessitie of religion in common vvealth, it is cleerly proued, as vve• by the philosophers, as by deuines, that the end, and true felicitie of euer• man in this life, and of common vvealthe, consisteth in religion. And finalli• it is declared, hovv temporall commodityes may serue, and avayle to th• felicitie of common vvealth. CHAP. IIII.

    _ That the felicitie vvhich vvicked men place in sensualitie, riches, honours, and vvorldly delightes, is no felicitie, but miserie: and that there is no true contentment, or happines but in God. And by the vvay, the vanitie of the vvorld, and vvorldly men, is euidently shevved. CHAP. V.

    _ That ciuill society is subordinat to religious, or ecclesiastical society: that is to say to the Church. And by that occasion it is declared, hovv much religion hath benne honored, and respected in profane common vvelths: and the eminent dignity of the Church of Christ is touched by the vvay. Also certaine conclusions are dravvne out of all precedent chapters, and some groundes laid, for the better examination of false religions, to vvit of Paganisme, Mahometisme, Iudaisme, Lutheranisme, and Caluinisme. CHAP. VI.

    _ The absurdity of Paganisme, is shevved in the religion of the auncient Romanes, and that the same vvas no lesse contrary to true reason of state then to true religio: not only for the vanity of their gods, and the impiety of their sacrifices, and ridiculous ceremonies: but also for the bad effectes of vice, and all kind of vvickednes, vvhich it produced in their common vvelth. CHAP. VII.

    _ That the profession of the Augurs, and Southsaiers amongst the Romans, an• all their manner of diuination, was friuolous, vaine, and most pernitio• to their common welth: Also that their religion could not but breed• Atheisme in verie manie of the professors of yt, and was also in that respect contrarie to reason of state: to which purpose yt ys declared, how Atheism• destroieth common welth. CHAP. 8.

    _ That the corruption of manners, and the vice vvhich grevv of Paganisme could not but be very preiudiciall to the Roman common vvelth, to vvhich end, the necessitie of vertue for the conseruation of state, and the dammage that follovveth of vice is declared, vvith diuers politicall obseruations, and rules out of Plato to the same purpost: And to the end it may appeare, hovv the Roman common vvelth could stand, and encrease, to so great an empyre, as it did, vvith the exercise of that religion, it is signified, that as God out of his prouidence did conserue, and encrease their estate, to the end, that he might build his Church in tyme vppon the ruyns of their empyre: so also he punished the same most seuerely from tyme to tyme, for their impious religion, vvhich appeareth in this chapter, from the foundation of Rome, vntill the expulsion of their Kings. CHAP. IX.

    _ A continuation of the same matter, to shevv the seuerity of Gods iustice in punishing the Romans, from the expulsion of the Kinges, vntil the first vvarr of Carthage, vvith a perfect Epitome, or abridgement, of the Roman history during that tyme. CHAP. X.

    _ The epitome of the Roman Historie is continued, and the examplar punishment of God vppon the Romans, further obserued, from the beginninge of the first vvarre of Carthage, vntill the ouerthrovv of their common vvelth, & the birth of our Sauiour Christ, vnder Augustus Caesar, the first Roman Emperour. CHAP. XI.

    _ A prosecution of the same matter, vvith a continuation of the abridgement of the Roman Historie, from Augustus Caesar, vntill the empire of Constantine the great, the first Christian emperour. Also the extreame tirannie of the pagan Emperours, their pe•secutions of the Church, hovv long euerie one of them reigned, and in vvhat manner, and yeare they died, and finallie the horrible calamities, and miseries inflicted by Gods iustice vpon them, and the Roman empire during their raigne. CAP. XII.

    _ The conclusion of the foure former chapters, concerning the religion, comm••vvelth, and empire of the Romans, and first of the amplitude of their dominio• their great vvelth, and povver, and the meanes hovv they attained vnto it is br•efly signified, vvith a compendious recapitulation of their calamities, vvhich aproued to be farre greater then the miseries, and calamities of Christiās haue be•• at any tyme. And finally it is declared, hovv their great povver, and ample d•minion, serued for the propagation of the faith, and Church of Christ: vvhere it appeareth, hovv his prouidence in the conseruation and amplification of the state, for the good of his church, concurred vvith his iustice in their seuere punis•ment, for the abominable impiety of their religion. CHAP. 13.

    _ The absurdity not only of Mahometisme, (vvhich the Turkes, Persians, an•Africans professe) but also of Iudaisme (as it is novv at this day professed, 〈◊〉 practised by the Iewes) is amply declared; vvith the ridiculous lyes, falsities, a•• errours, taught in the Alcorā of Mahomet, & in the Thalmud of the Iewe• no lesse contrary to reason of state, then repugnant to the veritie of religion. CHAP. 14.

    _ 〈◊〉•he verity, dignity, fruit, and necessity of Christian religion in common vvelth, in respect asvvel of the purity, and excellency of the doctrine, as also of the admirable force, and effects of Gods grace, vvhich it giueth for the repression of vice, and reformation of manners. And by the vvay, it is declared, hovv vainely the philosophers laboured, to reforme the discases in mans nature. CHAP. 15.

    _ 〈◊〉 is obiected that many Paynimes, and Infidels haue excelled in the moral, and ciuil vertues, though they vvere vtterlie void of grace. And for satisfaction of the obiection it is proued, that though they might haue, and had some vertues, yet they ••ld neuer vvithout grace, arriue to the perfection of morall vertue. Finally for the further proofe of the necessitie of grace, to the repression of vice, many examples are alleadged of the notable effects of grace, in the suddaine, and miraculous conuersion of sinners, and reformation of mens maners. CHAP. 16.

    _ The necessitie of Christian religion, for the good gouerment of state is further prou• by the end, and felicity of man, and common vvelth, because the same can••• be obtained but by Christian religion. And for as much, as it is declared befor• that asvvel the Pagan philosophers, as our Christian deuines, place the felicity 〈◊〉 man, and of common vvelth in contemplation (vvhich is an act of religion, 〈◊〉 it is here discussed vvhat maner of contemplation, the philosophers required this felicitie, vvhat practise they had of it, vvhat delight they taught to 〈◊〉 in it: and lastlie, vvhat experience they had of that vvhich they taught concerning the same.
CHAP. 17.

    _ Of Christian contemplation vvhat it is, hovv it serueth it selfe of philosophical contemplation, and hovv it differeth from it, vvhat excellent meane it hath to attaine to perfect vnion vvith God, in the vvhich consisteth the end, and felicitie of man, and common vvealth: Also of three vvayes practised by contemplatiue Christians, to arriue to the perfection of contemplation, to vvit, the Purgatiue vvay, the Illuminatiue vvay, and the Vnitiue vvay: and first some practise is shovved of the Purgatiue vvay, verie necessarie for beginners, and for the conuersion of sinners. CHAP. 18.

    _ Of the Illuminatiue vvay, and the practise of it, vvith certaine obseruations for the remedy of dictractions, and spirituall desolation or sterrility of spirit, vvhich may occure in the exercise thereof. Also certaine meditations, to be practised by those, that desire to profit in the seruice of God, and in the vvay of vertue, and to arriue to the perfection of contemplation. CHAP. 19.

    _ Of the Vnitiue vvay, and the practise of it, vvith rules to be obserued in the exercise thereof and meditations belonging to it. CHAP. 20.

    _ Of certaine other meditations proper, to the Vnitiue vvay, and of the excesse of spirit, called by the contemplatiues Ecstasis, and of rapts, and the diuersity of deuine fauours, and the ineffable consolations, vvhich God imparteth to his seruants in the perfect practise thereof; vvhereby it is euident, that true vnion vvith God, and consequentlie the cheefe felicity of man in this life, and of common vvealth, consisteth in Christian contemplation. CHAP. 21.

    _ It is obiected that to make a common vvealth happy by such a christian, contempl•tion as hath been discribed, all the Citizens must be religious men, such as haue •bandoned the vvorld. The obiection is ansvvred; & it is proued that euery me•ber of a Christian common vvealth (of vvhat degree, state, or vocation soe••• he be) may be a perfect contemplatiue: and happie in his vocation: Also vvh• is the perfection vvhich Christ requireth in euery Christiā man: & by the vv•• some vvhat is said of the actiue and cōtemplatiue life, according to the opinio• as vvell of philosophers, as of our deuins. CHAP. 22.

    _ To proue that anie Christian man may bee a perfect contemplatiue in anie lav•full vocation, diuers exampls are alledged of holie, and contemplatiue King• VVherouppon it is inferred, that meaner men, vvho haue lesse occasion to ••uert them selues from contemplation, may bee perfect contemplatiues. CHAP. 23.

    _ •ertaine friuolous obiections of Macchiauel against Christian religion are ansvvered, and his impietie, and ignorance discouered. CHAP. 24.

    _ That the Christian religion which geueth true felicitie to common welth, is no other but the Catholike Roman religion, because the same onlie hath the true Christian, and Euangelicall perfection, consisting in the imitation of Christ: an• that consequentlie it hath the onlie meanes to vnit man with God. CHAP. 25.

    _ A continuation of the same matter, to proue the continuall discent of religious disciplin, from the first 300. yeares after Christ, vntill our time, by the occasion whereof, the beginnings, and authours, of al the different professions, and order of religions in Gods Church, are declared: with the reasons, and causes, why it is c•nuenient, that there should be so many different orders in the Church of God, and that his mercifull prouidence, and bountie euidentlie appeareth therein: finally that the most holie learned, and famous men in Gods Church, haue professed, or alowed religious life, and that the later orders of religion, doe not differ either in matter of faith, or in substance of religious disciplin, from the first monkes, or religious of the primatiue Church. CHAP. 26.

    _ 〈◊〉 God hath in all times and ages, giuen testimonie of his vnion with religious ••en, by manie extraordinarie fauours bestowed vppon them, as by exstases, and •rapts, by visions, reuelations, the spirit of prophesie, and the operation of miracles, whereof examples are alleadged in euerie age, from the primitiue church, •euen vntill this day: And thereuppon it is concluded, that the Roman Catholikes, hauing the true imitation of Christ in religious disciplin, and all the externall signes of Gods internall vnion with them, haue not onlie the perfection of Christian religion, but also the cheefe felicitie of man in this life, and of common wealth. CHAP. 27

    _ That the aduersaries of the Roman Church at these dayes, haue no perfect imita••on of Christ, and therefore no perfection of Christian religion, nor vnitie w• God, and consequentlie, no true felicitie either for themselues, or for the comm••welth. And for this purpose it is proued, that they haue no practise of the Eua•gelicall Counsels of our Sauiour: and first touching voluntary pouertie, the pr•ctise whereof, is deduced from our Sauiours example, and expresse words, b•sides the authority, and vniforme consent of all the ancient Fathers: and by t•• way, the distinction betwixt our Sauiours precepts, and counsels (denied by 〈◊〉 aduersaries) is clearelie proued, the shifts and false gloses of Luther, Calui• and their fellowes, discouered, and confuted. CHAP. 28

    _ Of the Euangelical counsel of Chastity, grounded vppon our Sauiours example, and expresse wordes, according to the interpretation of the ancient Fathers. Also the cauils, and peruerse gloses of our aduersaries, are detected, and reiected. CHAP. 29.

    _ To the end it may appeare, that our aduersaries neither haue, nor accordinge to their principles can haue, anie practise at al of the euangelical counsel of Chastity, their Mahometical doctrin (teaching an impossibilitie to liue chast) is amplie, and particularlie declared out of their owne workes, and proued to be most absurd, in respect both of reason of state, and also of experience, and common sense, yea, sufficiētlie controwled, and confuted by the Painimes and Infidels. Also the bad and beastlie effects of that doctrin, are testified by the licentious liues of their cheefe masters, or teachers. Finaliie diuers of their friuolous obiections, and vaine cauils concerning this point, are fullie answered. CHAP. 30.

    _ 〈◊〉 the third Euangelical counsel, to wit, perfect Obedience and abnegation of our selues, deduced out of the expresse doctrin of our Sauiour, and confirmed by the testimonie of the Fathers, and examples of Gods miraculous approbation thereof, in diuers cases. Also that our aduersaries haue not so much practise thereof, as the very painimes had, nor so much as any disposition thereto: and this is proued by the intollerable pride of their cheefe masters, which appeareth partly in their owne workes, and partly by the testimonies of one of them against an other. Finally it is made most euident, that they are not only voide of all true imitation of Christ, and christian perfection, but also that they are sw•rne enemies of it, and therefore farre from all vnion with God, and true felicitie. CHAP. 31.

    _ VVhere as it is shewed, that the Roman Catholikes, haue all the externall sig• that may be, of Gods externall vnion with them, (to wit, ecstases, rapts, a• reuelations, the spirit of prophesie, visions, and apparitions of our Sauiour, Angels and Sainctes, and the operation of manifestest miracles:) it is h• examined, what our aduersaries can pretend to haue had, or to haue in t• kind: and it is proued, that they haue had nothing els, but certaine counte• fet miracles, which haue miscaried vnder their hands, illusions of wicked s••rits, idle and phantasticall dreames, horrible visions, and apparitions of •uils, and fained reuelations. Lastly, their obiections against our miracle• are confuted, and they concluded to be wilfully blynd. CHAP. 32.

    _ For the finall conclusion of the question, concerning the Euangelicall Counsells, and religious life, the matter of religious vowes is debated, and defended against our aduersaries. Also, that the continencie of clergy men, is beneficiall to the common wealth, and that certaine wicked, Emperours, who hau• sought by lawes to restraine, & to prohibit monasticall life, haue bene seuerelie punished by almighty God for the same. Finallie a breefe recapitulation is made of all the premisses, concerning the true imitation of Christ, and our aduersaries are thereby conuinced, to be vtterly void, aswell of all Christian perfection, as of the true felicitie of man, and common welth. CHAP. 33.

    _ Certaine obiections of the Politikes, out of the lawes of diuers Emperours and Kinges, against religious disciplin are ansuered, and the impietie of the said lawes is shewed, by the notable punishment of God vppon the lawe makers. VVith a breefe recapitulation, and conclusion of all the former chapters, concerning religious discipline.
CHAP 34.

    _ To proue that the Catholike religion is conforme to true reason of state, and the contrary doctrin repugnant thereto, ten points, controuersed betwixt the Catholikes, and their aduersaries, are debated by way of state: and it is euidently shewed, that the doctrin of Catholikes, leadeth to all vertue, and is therefore most conuenient for state, and that the doctrin of their aduersaries, eyther withdraweth from vertue, or inciteth to vice, and consequently is most pernicious to all states. Finally, the bad frute of Lutheranisme and Caluinisme in Common welth, is shewed by the experience thereof, sufficiently acknowledged by Luther, Caluin, and others their fellowes. CHAP. 35.

    _ Three obiections are answered. The first, concerning the bad liues of some Catholikes. The second touching the good liues of some Lutherans, and Caluinists. And the third concerning their exhortatiōs to vertue, and by occasion heereof, it is amply proued that the mortificatiō or chastisemēt of the flesh, is necessary to good life. Also that the worst, and most vicious Catholiks, are commonly those which become Lutherans, or Caluinists. Lastly that the exhortations, which Luther, and Caluin vsed to induce men to vertue, and to withdraw them from vice, were ridiculous in them, being wholy repugnant to their religion, and by the way they are fitly compared to Epicurus, & his followers, as well for their doctrin, as for their manner in the deliuery of it. CHAP. 36.

    _ The conclusion of this treatise, deuided into two chapters. And first, in this, a breefe recapitulation of the whole, with certaine considerations resulting therin, concerning our vnion with God, christian perfection, & felicitie, woorthy to be well pondered of euery christian man: And next, certaine douts are cleared, touching christian perfection: & how farre it may extend it selfe in this life. CHAP. 37.

    _ An obiection of our aduersaries concerning christian perfection, is fully answered, whereby their doctrin of imputatiue iustice is confuted: with an application of all the former discourse to common welth, by the consideration of 4. notable effects of charitie, by the which it is proued, that the Catholike Roman Religion only, geeueth true felicitie to common welth. CHAP. 38.
